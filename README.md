# FASCINATE: Fast Cross-layer Dependency Inference on Multi-layered Networks
## Overview

The package contains the following files:
- AminerData.mat: Aminer dataset in Matlab format
- fascinate.m: function file for FASCINATE algorithm
- fascinate_zero.m: function file for FASCINATE-ZERO, which infers the dependency for zero-start nodes
- restoreD.m: function file to restore the dependencies with latent feature matrices
- demo.m: script file to run FASCINATE and FASINATE-ZERO

## Usage
Please refer to the demo code demo.m and comments in each file for the detailed information
